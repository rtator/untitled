I walked backwards, surprised. she lifted the white board up. there was a blue thing that looked like a portal. she said "jump through the portal." what!!!! it was a portal! I went through. she turned into a fly, and got bigger. "hop on," she said "or you can eat this frog". I ate the frog and stuck my tongue.</field></shadow></value></block></next></block></next></block></next></block></statement></block></xml>
